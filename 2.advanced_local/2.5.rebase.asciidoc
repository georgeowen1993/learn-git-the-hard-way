=== Git Rebase

Rebasing is one of the most commonly-discussed advanced git topics.

In essence it's quite simple, but it can get very confusing.

Following this you're going to learn about rebasing and fast-forwarding with
a simple example, so pay attention!

Let's say we have a set of changes on a master branch:

image::diagrams/2.5.1.mermaid.png[]

NOTE: The diagrams in this book are left-right in time order, whereas the
'git log' is bottom-up in time order.

and at this point you branch off to 'feature1' and make another change:

image::diagrams/2.5.2.mermaid.png[]

Now you go back to master and make a couple more changes:

image::diagrams/2.5.3.mermaid.png[]

Now think about this from the point of view of the developer of feature1. She
has made a change from point C on the master branch, but the situation has moved
on. Now if master wants to merge in the change on feature1, it could merge it
in, and the tree would look like this:

image::diagrams/2.5.4.mermaid.png[]


That is OK, but not entirely desirable for two reasons:

- The history has just got more complicated
- We have introduced an extra new change (G), which is the merge of D and F

Wouldn't it be better if the history looked like this?

image::diagrams/2.5.5.mermaid.png[]

This is much cleaner and easier to follow. If, for example, a bug was
introduced in D, it's easier to find (eg using bisect, which we will come
onto).
Also, the feature1 branch can be safely deleted without any significant
information being lost, making the history tidier and simpler.

If we remind ourselves of the situation pre-merge (above)then we can 
visualise 'picking up' the changes on the feature1 branch and moving them
to the HEAD. So from this:

image::diagrams/2.5.3.mermaid.png[]
----
A
|
B
|
C
|\
E D (feature1)
|
F (HEAD, master)
----

To this:

image::diagrams/2.5.5.mermaid.png[]
----
A
|
B
|
C
|
E
|
F (HEAD, master)
 \
  D (feature1)
----

This is what a rebase is: you take a set of changes from a particular point
and apply them from a different point - re-base!

NOTE: be aware that people also talk about rebasing to 'squash' commits. This is
a slightly different scneario that uses the same rebase command.

Let's walk through the above scenario with git commands.

----
rm -rf 2.5.1
mkdir 2.5.1
cd 2.5.1
git init
echo A > file1
git add file1
git commit -am A
echo B >> file1
git commit -am B
echo C >> file1
git commit -am C

git checkout -b feature1
echo D >> file1
git commit -am D

git checkout master
echo E >> file1
git commit -am E
echo F >> file1
git commit -am F

git log --all --decorate --graph

We are now in this state:

image::diagrams/2.5.3.mermaid.png[]

We go to feature1 and rebase:

----
git checkout feature1
git rebase master
# First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
# Applying: D
# Using index info to reconstruct a base tree...
# M	file1
# Falling back to patching base and 3-way merge...
# Auto-merging file1
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file1
# Failed to merge in the changes.
# Patch failed at 0001 D
# The copy of the patch that failed is found in:
#    /Users/imiell/gitcourse/tmprebase/.git/rebase-apply/patch
# 
# When you have resolved this problem, run "git rebase --continue".
# If you prefer to skip this patch, run "git rebase --skip" instead.
# To check out the original branch and stop rebasing, run "git rebase --abort".
vi file1
git add file1
git rebase --continue
# Applying: D
git log --all --decorate --graph

Now the changes are in one line we can merge the feature1 master branch.

git checkout master

#  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

==== Fast-forwarding

What's interesting about the above is this:

----
git merge feature1
# Updating cb548ab..eff7c3a
# Fast-forward
#  file1 | 1 +
#  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
----

Because the changes are in a line, no new changes need to be made - the master
branch pointer merely needs to be 'fast-forwarded' to the same point as 
feature1! The HEAD pointer, naturally, moves with the branch we're on (master).
